# project-3-group-7
		
Goal: utilize the Austin, Texas House Listings dataset to explore historical data that would give us insight into the Austin housing market. Our group was interested in identifying trends we may see over time or patterns we may observe. From there our goal was to design a functional data application that could hopefully be useful to those interested in the Austin market. To execute that we built a FLASK backend queried against a SQLITE database, and a HTML/JS front-end to facilitate user requests and aid in the dynamic building of our visualizations and interactive map.
