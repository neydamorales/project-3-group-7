Our study of the Austin housing market from 2018 to 2021 reveals a strong correlation between school ratings and home prices, with homes near top-rated schools seeing price differences up to $13.5 million. The rise and decline of Homeowner Associations (HOAs) since their peak in 2006 reflect changing buyer preferences. Expanding the analysis with recent data, demographics, and predictive models could offer further insights into future trends in the Austin market.
